# ATTiny85RCMixer

This is an Radio Control mixer that takes PWM inputs designed for e servo and converts them to PWM outputs for two DC motors.
The signals are crudly mixed for differential thust. One motor has the thrust plus the rudder. The second thrust minus the rudder.

It should work for 1s (3.7v LiPo) or 5V. I am developing for 1s using small brushed corless motors.
